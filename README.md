## 🧠 Research

I am driven by elegant solution methods in robot learning and control that target **high performance**, **safety guarantees**, **data efficiency**, and **robust generalization**—key milestones toward **embodied intelligence**.

I am open to exploring theoretical and practical aspects of robotics, leveraging my background in:
- Control theory
- Differentiable optimization
- Machine learning

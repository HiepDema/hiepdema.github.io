![Profile Picture](prof_pic.jpg)

I am currently involved in exciting projects, including AI-powered humanoid robots, sampling-based optimal control, and implicit deep learning.

I completed my **MS at Carnegie Mellon University** with [Zac Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zac-manchester/) as part of the **Robotic Exploration Lab**, Robotics Institute.  
In Summer 2023, I was a **Robotics Student Fellow** at the **Robotic Systems Lab**, ETH Zurich.  
I received my **BS in Control Engineering and Automation – Talent Program** at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

## 🧠 Research

I am driven by elegant solution methods in robot learning and control that target **high performance**, **safety guarantees**, **data efficiency**, and **robust generalization**—key milestones toward **embodied intelligence**.

I am open to exploring theoretical and practical aspects of robotics, leveraging my background in:
- Control theory
- Differentiable optimization
- Machine learning
